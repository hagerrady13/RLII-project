# RL_2_project

Actor-Critic:
- Try different step_sizes, 100 runs: 0.5 is the best
- Try using a gamma: doesn't matter

SARSA:
- Try different step_sizes, 100 runs: 0.5 is the best
- Try different epsilon: the lower the exploration, the better. best eps=0.0

To compare speed:
- First 50 episodes over 100 runs: AC is better

To compare performance:
- 500 episodes of 100 runs: better at the beginning but same at end
- Compare TD error?

Something like 12.5?
